# Elevator Floor Paradox

## 🛗 Idea
This project is inspired by the **Birthday Paradox**, but instead of birthdays,  
I’m looking at **elevators and floors**.  

The main question of the project is 
👉 What’s the probability that at least two people in the same elevator pick the same floor?



## 🎯 Why
I thought of this while riding an elevator: sometimes several people press the same button.  
It felt kinda like the Birthday Paradox, but with floors instead of birthdays. Since most of the elevators have maximum at 14 people per ride so I will set max
capacity at 14. (The numeber can be changed later on.)



## 🔧 What I’ll Do
- Simulate random floor selections.  
- Estimate the probability of shared floors.  
- Try different numbers of floors (e.g. 10, 20, 50).  
- Plot the results just for better understanding.  



## 🛠️ Tools
- Python  
- `numpy`, `matplotlib`  


## 📌 Note
This is a curiosity project, **not** serious research.
